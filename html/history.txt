  p_dir.c, p_about.c:
    - new own files for parse_dir() and parse_about().
    - parse_dir():  improved code to have the listing sorted by name/
      size/date.
    - parse_about():  if a 'about:cache' list has no clearable objects
      the '[clear]' link will be disabled now.

  parser.c:

      argument and find_key().

  parser.h:
    - line 26..65:  parse_tag() and all get_value*() functions get a
      struct PARSER as the first argument now.

  W_Struct.c:
    - line 17:  new static function _alloc() to allocate a chunk of 32
      word items at one go to reduce the number of malloc/free() calls.
      only for gcc this reduces render time a bit (best case down to
      80%) but for all compilers it reduces destroying time of frame
      structures considerably.

  Baldrick's patches (actually a few patches after a week of bug hunt)

  Parser.c
    These are some modifications I'm not 100% happy about.  They deal
    with some sites using a ' instead of " in the key area of tags

    - line 260-263 added if else pair to intercept ' and parse it
    - line 283 catch ' at end and handle advance

  Render.c
    - line 116 added a check for page and para being centered in get_align
      this gets rid of one of the remaining problems with centering
    - line 122 get_align() check if TableCell is a DummyFor if it is
      then get the data from the DummyFor pointer (DummyFor cells are
      blank cells coverd by ROWSPAN or COLSPAN) Thanks to Rainer
      for helping me track this one down.
    - line 556 parse_header_tag() added short cur_color to track the
      current font_step color
    - line 580 parse_header_tag() extract the current color
    - line 592 parse_header_tag() if color is -1 use the cur_color value
    - parse_p_tag() removed excess indents no code change

  Baldrick's patches

  AEI.C
    - reworked process_messages to handle all WM_ARROWED message types
      this allows realtime scrolling with programs like MWheel.  I put
      in full support even though MWheel doesn't seem to send them all
      but that could be a limitation of my IBM scroll point mouse.
      Scrolling is based on frame under Mouse pointer.

    - added ifndef EINVFN - define EINVFN for PureC (at least my copy)

  Rainer's patches

  global.h
    - Added aes_window_title_length, appl_xgetinfo().
    - removed prototype blit_block() - unused

  HighWire.c

  Rainer Seitel's patches (these may appear elsewhere as well)

  - For compiling with Pure C 1.1 (file size 226538, file date 1992-10-25), I had
    to move the declarations from Table__N.c to Table.h, then including Table.h
    and Containr.h at the end of defs.h.

  - I marked places with bugs or to do's with a comment beginning with the
    searchable "BUG: ".

  - I hope I replaced all path and file name sizes by HW_PATH_MAX. In defs.h it
    is defined as 260, which is the VFAT standard. This should done dynamically.

  - Added "/* @(#)highwire/filename.ext" as first line to all files changed by
    me. Exact two empty lines before every function.

  purewire.prj
    - Default char is explicitely unsigned char.
    - Stack size is explicitely set (open source!).

      - Make shure there is enough place for long numbers.
        Same as CAB, but shall we set the maximum to all when reaching </OL>?
    - Marked all BICS with a searchable comment "/* U+".
    - parse_anchor()
      - Check also for CHARSET and ID.
    - New: parse_meta_tag(), checks for Content-Type ... charset.
    - New: parse_q_tag(), prints language dependent qoutation marks.
    - Replaced all "int flag" by "BOOL start_tag" and deleted several
      explanations, only stating that flag means start tag. Using FALSE, TRUE.

  token.h:
    - Added tags META, PLAINTEXT, Q; keys CHARSET, CONTENT, HTTP_EQUIV,
      ID, LANG.

      an HTML file with <A CHARSET="..." HREF="...">...</A>.
    - Added all with BICS possible named character entities from HTML 4.
    - Added Unicode entities. Added conversion table Unicode to BICS (Bitstream
      International Character Set). (Better than the one in NVDI.) Added
      conversion table Unicode to Atari ST system font. Both are one character
      to multiple glyph conversions.
    - Added many const and static.

      it!
    - page_load(), build_fname()
      - Moved from keyinput.c.
      - Initialize the fsel path with start directory.
      - Added check for NULL pointer.

    - line 372 (containr_calculate):  modified to dial with fix sized
      frame geometries.
    - line 429 (containr_redraw):  modified to take over handling of

    - new structure 'word_line' to be used as a list of first word
      items for the lines of a paragraph.
    - removed old table stuff from paragraph definition.
    - added 'offset' attributes to structs clickable_area and
      named_location.

    - new_clickable_area() + new_named_location():  adapted to new
     'offset' attributes.

      buffer isn't empty.
    - word_store():  corrected size calculation for the paragraph's
      min_width.

    These both functions should be located somewhere else:
    - content_calc():  moved over text related calculations to a own
      funtion.

  Baldrick's last minute notes

  TABLE.C
    - I had to move the #ifndef _NEW_TABLES to get it to compile
      properly under PureC on my machine
    - I placed the define for _NEW_TABLES in global.h so that it
      was in the same location as GEM_MENU
    - the binary in the archive is compiled with NEW TABLE routines
      and a GEM Menu
    - Lattice HIGHWIRE.PRJ updated

  Scanner.h
    - added prototype for scan_upperchar()

  Scanner.c
    - new routine scan_upperchar()
    - added static WORD atari_char[]

  Render.C
    - line 2146  added case for handline *symbol < 0 or = 127
       we are handling symbol as a signed char so there really
       is no case where symbol > 127 (at least on compilers where
       signed chars are default).  So upper chars come in below
       0 (except 127)

  Char.txt
    - a text file with (hopefully) all of the upper range characters
      from the atari asci set.

      readability.

      that is nedded for a list of paragraphs, used for frames and
      table cells.

  render.c:
    - removed a lot of occurences of lines which reset the word buffer
      "p_frame->active_word = active_word_buffer;"  because this is now
      handled by word_store().
    - line 978 (parse_table_tag):  set the table_childs min_width by
      using content_minimum().
    - line 1329 (parse_img_tag):  removed setting of the frame's
      page_width, isn't necessary at this point.

   table.c, Redraw.c:
     replaced huge number of accessing of structure members and also
     pointer-pointer-pointer-... addressing by the usage of local
     variables.  this makes the code better readable and also allows the
     compiler to make better optimazions.

   defs.h:
     - replaced  enum paragraph_codes  by  typedef enum PARAGRAPH_CODE
       with upper cased members to avoid confusion with lower case

   render.c:
     - line 1439 (parse_frameset):  removed start_frame variable.
     - line 1510 (parse_frameset):  adapted new_loader_job() arguments
       and removed temp_frame.

   keyinput.c:
     line 64 (key_pressed):  adapted new_loader_job() arguments and
       removed temp_frame.

   Mouse_R.c:

   AltF4's Patches

   global.h:
     - removed global variable declarations add_to_do and read_to_do,
       no longer in use.
     - added frame and clipping_area arguments to
       calculate_frame_locations().

   defs.h:
     - replaced the 'struct frame_item {...}' by 'typedef struct
       frame_item {...} * FRAME'.  this allows shorter argument lists
       for function declarations and better readable code.
     - removed all of the 'Flow Control Constructs' at the end (the
       to_do_... declarations), no longer in use.

   Variable.c:
     - removed global variables add_to_do and read_to_do, no longer in
       use.

   Container.h:
     - added structure members Area, Name, Border, removed _debug.
     - new functions containr_setup(), containr_Base(),
       containr_relocate(), containr_calculate(), containr_redraw().

   Container.c
     new functions:
     - containr_setup() to attach a frame to container,
     - containr_Base() to get the base parent container of a frame,
     - containr_relocate() to new positions for container and frames,
     - containr_calculate() to calculate positions and sizes of
       containers and frames,
     - containr_redraw() as replacement for the frame based redraw().

   Loader.h:
     - moved over the typedef FRAME to defs.h.

   Loader.c:
     - in parser_job():
       - added containr_setup() and containr_calculate() calls.
       - containr_redraw() is called for every redy frame now.  this way
         the user can start viewing while there are still parts to be
         parsed.  this also helps debugging.
     - in init_load(), resorted window setting.

   AEI.c:
     all changes in process_messages():
     - case WM_MOVED:  replaced wind_set() by wind_set_grect() and
       calculate_frame_locations() by containr_relocate().
     - case WM_SIZED:  replaced calculate_frame_locations() by
       containr_calculate().
     - case WM_REDRAW:  replaced redraw() by containr_redraw().
     - case WM_FULLED:  replaced calculate_frame_locations() by
       containr_calculate().

   render.c:
     - all changes in parse_frameset():
       - added argument container.
       - variable border removed, will be handled in the tag scopes
         instead.
       - variables cur_xoffset and cur_yoffset removed since geometric
         calculations are no longer done here but in containr_setup().
     - in parse_html() case TAG_FRAMESET, added container argument to
       parse_frameset() call.

   F_Calc.c:
    all changes in calculate_frame_locations():
      - added frame and clipping_area arguments to function.
      - outcommented a lot of stuff that is now already done by
        containr_calculate().

   Makefile:
     improved for different processor targets.

February 8, 2002

   AltF4's Patches

   Containr.c, Containr.h:
     new module for struct CONTAINR to take over structural aspects of
     frame_item.  there are nearly no comments in it, I will make up for
     this soon.

   defs.h:
     line 308 ff:
     - added temporary anonymous pointer attribute Container.
     - outcommented atrribute next_frame.  declared temporary function
       frame_next() to be used instead (just behind the struct).

   render.c:
     - line 941 (parse_table_tag) + 1135 (parse_td_tag):
       set color to -1 if not defined as tag attribute to allow
       transparency for table items.
     - function parse_html() completely reworked to make use of the new
       container structure/functions.

   Redraws.c:
    - line 987 + 940 (draw_table):
      added if(color >= 0) to allow transparency for table items.
    - line 164 (redraw):
      replace acces to next_frame attribute by frame_next() call.

   Loader.c
     made a lot of changes to make use of the new container structure/
     functions.  sensless to write them down because most of the  will
     be changed again in the very near future.

   F_Calc.c:
     - line 45 + 200 (calculate_frame_locations):
       replace acces to next_frame attribute by frame_next() call.
     - line 24:
      new macro PercentOf() for calculating absolute values from
      percents.  this seems also solve the problem that sometimes a one
      pixel column at the very right side of the window wasn't filled.
    - in calculate_frame_locations(), replaced all calculations of
      absolute values from percent by the new PercentOf() macro.

   F_Struct.c:
     - line 10: (destroy_frame_structure)
       replaced while by if, no more need to walk through a list.
     - line 8 + 20 + 22: (destroy_frame_structure)
       removed acces to next_frame attribute.
     - line 37: (init_frame)
       initialize anonymous pointer attribute.
     - line 39: (init_frame)
       removed acces of next_frame attribute.

   Mouse_R.c
    - line 32 (button_clicked) + 318 (frame_clicked)
      + 375 (check_mouse_position):
      replace acces to next_frame attribute by frame_next() call.

   keyinput.c
     - line 55 (key_pressed):
       replace acces to next_frame attribute by frame_next() call.

   Makefile, purewire.prj, highwire.prj: updated

   Baldrick's Patches

   TABLE.C
     - calculate_subtable_height() no longer called.  Possibly will
       be removed shortly
     - left_border removed in calculate_table_height()
     - table->borders.left used in place of left_border
     - removed calculate_subtable_height() routine no longer used
     - cleaned up some old remmed out lines involving the old
        colspan implementation
     - some other unused snipets that were rem'd out removed
     - reworked system in caculate_table_height() text processing
         now in else { }
     - reworked system in walk_table_children() text processing now
        in else {  }
     - fixed a typo in sub table height calculation

February 6, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   TABLE.C
     - new routine set_p_area() - sets a paragraphs area coordinates
     - modificaitons of calculate_table_height to use set_p_area.

February 5, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   DEFS.H
    - added	struct table_item *parent; to table_step struct
    - renamed paragraph * in table_step to entry
      modifications in table.c, render.c and redraws.c

   TABLE.C
    - added table_item *parent parameter to new_table_step() and
      add_table_step()
    - patched empty_child routines
    - modification of colspan handling in all routines that
       modified based on colspan

   GLOBAL.H
    - new definitions for new_table_step() and add_table_step()

   RENDER.C
    - modifications for new table step routines and struct
    - modifications for insertion of empty children to make
       space for colspan rowspan

   REDRAWS.C
    - modifications for new table step routines and struct
    - modification of colspan handling in draw_table routine
    - removed draw_subtable() it was no longer used

   AltF4's Patches

   render.c
    - line 1862: renamed calculate_frame() to parse_html().
    - line 1571: removed #else .. #endif part, wasn't used anymore
               since a longer time. parse_frameset()
    - line 1556 + 1565: replaced add_load_item_to_to_do_list() by
               new_loader_job(). parse_frameset()
    - line 1556: the 't_frame->frame_name' gets its value from
               get_value_str() now to avoid useless copies. parse_frameset()
    - line 1538: removed the  #if 1  and the following
             if (!get_value...)  block, not longer used. parse_frameset()
    - line 1393: removed frame_name[], no longer in use. parse_frameset()
    - line 12:   added  #include "Loader.h".

   HighWire.c
    - line 30:  changed the timer value from 100 to 1.
    - line 162: replaced check_to_do_list() by schedule().
    - line 14:  added  #include "schedule.h".

   Mouse_R.c:
    - line 312 + 329: replaced add_load_item_to_to_do_list() by
           new_loader_job()
    - line 8:  added  #include "Loader.h".

   keyinput.c:
    - line 73: replaced add_load_item_to_to_do_list() by
               new_loader_job()
    - line 15: added  #include "Loader.h".

   Makefile, purewire.prj, highwire.prj:
     updated: inserted schedule.c, removed To_do.c

   schedule.c, shedule.h:
    - new module for general purpose job control.  the functions here
      don't know anything about internal structures like frame_item
      but are handeling all arguments as anonymous pointers.  This way
      it can also be used later for eg. decoding images.

   Loader.c:
    - new functions new_loader(), loader_job(), new_loader_job() to
      take over some functionalities from To_do.c and make use of
      schedule.c instead.
    - new functions parser_job(), set_parser_job() to take over some
      functionalities from To_do.c and make use of schedule.c instead.
      this both functions should really placed somewhere else but atm
      I'm not shure about the right file.
    - added  #include "schedule.h"  and  "Loader.h".
    - replaced add_load_item_to_to_do_list() by new_loader_job().

   Loader.h
    - I placed here some declarations which I will need to change soon
      again.  this way at least gcc compiles much faster after changes.

   To_do.c
     all of its functionality is now splitted off into schedule.c and
     Loader.c, so it becomes obsolete now.

   global.h
    - renamed calculate_frame() to parse_html() because that matches
      more its functionality, corresponding to parse_text().  Also
      moved this declaration to the render.c section where it belongs.

February 4, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   TO_DO.C
     changed include aes.h to gemx.h

   REDRAWS.C
     experiments walking paragraphs around table draws
     recall draw_table() instead of draw_subtable()

     draw_table() replaced left_border, right_b.. and bottom_b...
       with current_table->current_borders.

   DEFS.H
     new struct BORDERS tracks left, right bottom
     added sturct borders current_borders to table item

   P_STRUCT.C
     added init to 0 in new_paragraph() for paragraph.area values

   TABLE.C
     uncovered the fact that paragraph.area values weren't being
       set for tables.  This was a problem since the redraw routines
       needed these values

Alot of undocumented changes :< all in table routines though.  Drawing
calculating and parsing.

February 1, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches
     #if 0'd out the empty child insertion routines for the moment
     going to sync the updates and can't finish it in time.

   TO_DO.C
      included aes.h for PureC for graf_mkstate

   AltF4's patches

   O_Struct.c:
     - removed the unnecessary #include <gemx.h>.

   AEI.c:
     - resorted the #include lines for better readability.

     - replaced <gemx.h> by <gem.h> to make compiling a bit faster.

   HighWire.c:
   	 - resorted the #include lines for better readability.

   	 - in the event loop, moved the check_to_do_list() call to the end
   	  (line 135 -> 158) to avoid double redrawing at start up.  Not
   	  doing so let HighWire recive the initial redraw message of the
   	  wind_open() just after redrawing of the finished page.

   	 - the check_mouse_position() is now triggered by MU_M1 events
   	  instead of MU_TIMER.  this way it is only called if the mouse
   	  really moved and saves some cpu time for background processes
   	  (11% -> 8% cpu load on my system).

   	 - replaced evnt_multi() by evnt_multi_fast().  the latter gets
   	  only three pointers instead of a LOT and saves this way some cpu
   	  time.  the apropriated EVMULT_IN struct just before the main()
   	  function.

   To_do.c:
     - line 104:  added check_mouse_position(), else the changes above
      dosn't work properly with links in frames.

     - line 112:
       removed an old #ifdef, was only used for speed meassurment in
       the past.

     - removed the unnecessary #include <gemx.h> and resorted the other
      include lines for better readability.

     - added new function copy_to_do() to avoid duplicate code in
      check_to_do_list().

     - in add_load_item_to_to_do_list() replaced malloc()/strcpy()
      calls by strdup().

     - reformatted the complete code to get the code readable.

January 31, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   TABLE.C
     current_height replaced with current_table->temp_long in calculate
       table height routines

     removed test for table->num_cols > 1 in advacing table height
       in calculate table height and subtable height routines

     new routine struct table_child *insert_empty_child (struct table_child *prev)
       this inserts our empty holders into table structures to fill
       the spaces left by colspan and rowspan

   REDRAWS.C
     removed test for table->num_cols == 1 in righ border setting in
       draw_table routine

     WORD pts[4] use in draw_table() and draw_subtable() replaced with
       current_table->screen_pts

     variable WORD u removed from draw_frame_contents()

     variable WORD junk removed from draw_subtable()

     #if 0 rem'd out hopefully not needed test in draw_table() and draw_subtable()
       if we still need it make certain to remove line after #endif

   RENDER.C
     created table child walking routine in parse_table_tag() close to
       insert empty children into table child structure.  This is to help
       with the support for colspan and rowspan

   DEFS.H
     addition of WORD screen_pts[4]; /* on screen rectangle of table */
       to struct table_item

   Global.h
     insert prototype for insert_empty_child

January 30, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   REDRAWS.C
   	bottom border now long

   	y_offsets in many routines converted back to longs


   Render.c
     changed tests in parse td tags to be num_rows == 1 instead of <= 1

     in case TAG_TR added a test to see if the number of columns in the table
       is greater than 0.  If it is then it adds a new row.  The reason is
       the default value for number of rows is 1 now, this is to cope with
       some sites with bad html, missing the initial tr tag before the first
       row.

   TABLE.C
     num_rows default 1 now in new_table().  The logic behind this
       is a bit odd, but it works.  The reason is that there are
       sites with bad html that do not have a tr tag before the first
       row, but do later on.  So if it is 0 then we end up with a
       table with one row instead of 2.  See note in render regarding
       tr tag

January 29, 2002

   Baldrick's Patches

   DEFS.H
     added long temp_long;	/* a temp long used mainly for height tracking */
       to table_item struct

   TABLE.C
     temporarily removed table walking in height calculations

   REDRAWS.C
     removed current_line_width in draw_table routines, now use
       direct value since it wasn't being modified
     renamed some parameters in the drawing routines just
       to ease my reading them today
     removed variable old_height and use y offset directly since
       it was not modified in the table drawing routines
     variable u renamed to junk since this is what it is in table
       drawing routines
     new routine static void set_veffects(struct word_item *current_word)
       just some standard recurring vdi effects in this module
     set_veffects() replaces code in draw_frame_contents and table
       drawing routines
     table_item->temp_long replaces current_height in table drawing
       routines

   Note once we get this sorted out we can see about reducing some of
     these struct entries again


Some notes.

Subtable isn't always being entered
We need to set pts array in table drawing closer to calling sub routines

   Baldrick's Patches

   TABLE.C
     experiments with walking table paragraphs in height calculations

   AltF4's Patches

   Loader.c:
     in get_decoder_type():
     - line 103:  replaced strchr() by strrchr(), else a file named
       like 'foo.bar.htm' is taken as a raw text file because the
       '.bar' is found as extension instead of '.htm'.
     - line 114:  added 'php' as an extension for html files -- this
       makes testing of downloaded pages easier.

   parser.h, parser.c, render.c:
     - the parse() function is now renamed to parse_tag() because the
       previous function name is really too unspecific.
     - comments are now handled by parse_tag() in parser.c.  this way
       it is also working for framesets and titles.

   render.c:
     - removed comment handling (is done by parse_tag() now).
     - implemented skip_style() and skip_script() to filter out the yet
       not interpreted css and javascript parts.

   token.h:
     added SCRIPT, NOSCRIPT, STYLE keywords.

January 25, 2002

   Baldrick's patches

   TABLE.C
     - current_table->temp_val used to replace temp_cols in
        calculate_table_height() and calculate_subtable_height()
     - almost all routines in TABLE.C drop current_paragraph variable
        in favour of using the pointer in the table_item
     - word_item *current_word replace with frame->current_word in
        calculate_table_height() and calculate_subtable_height()
     - current_child replaced with table->current_child in
       calculate_subtable_height() and calculate_table_height()
     - table_w in calc subtable_height() and calc table_height()
       replaced with current_table->actual_width
     - modifications to increase current_height in one column tables


   DEFS.H
     - added current_paragraph * to table_item struct, this lets
        us track paragraphs inside seperate tables
     - removed container value from frame_item struct

   REDRAWS.C
     - removed table_paragraph * from draw_table() replaced with
       table->current_paragarph
     - a test routine, draw_subtable() this isn't permanent, I'm
       using it for some testing

January 24, 2002

   Baldrick's patches

   TABLE.C
     - put width test back into calculate_table_height() when walking
        words.
     - check if table has more than 1 column before testing and reset
        of column/row data in calculate_table_height(), walk_table_children(),
        calculate_table_width(),calculate_subtable_width(),calculate_subtable_height()
     NOTE there is the potential of rewritting how col_span is handled
       which would eliminate the need for these tests

January 23, 2002

   Baldrick's patches

   LOADER.C
    - short test forcing PureC to use stat() call.  It works here
      I sent a message out to the list to clarify if we really
      need all these tests in load_file()

   AltF4's patches

   LOADER.C
    - line 155:
      removed unused definition of file_info (is also defined in the
      following else scope).
    - line 189:
      reordered the #ifdef to enable again the gcc binary to load
      files without MiNT/Magic.

   HighWire.c:
    - line 42:
      removed leading '\\' of the address string to make shure that
      the start page is also found without MiNT/Magic.

   parser.c, parser.h:
    - added new functions get_value_char() to get only the first
      character of a value and get_value_unum() to get a value as a
      unsigned number directly.

   render.c:
    - modified parse_li_tag() for use of new get_value_char() and
      get_value_unum() functions.  this avoids the output of funny
      markers for something like <LI VALUE="-7"> or <LI VALUE="1%">.
      Furthermore the marker toggeling of <UL>s inside other <UL>s is
      working correctly now.
    - in parse_ol_tag(), parse_table_tag(), parse_td_tag():  modified
      for use of new get_value_char() and get_value_unum() functions.
    - in parse_div_tag(), parse_header_tag(), parse_img_tag(),
      parse_hr_tag(), parse_p_tag(), parse_ul_tag():  modified for use
      of new get_value_char() function.

January 22, 2002

   AltF4's patches

   GLOBAL.H
    - changed parameter list of new_word()
    - corrected comments with respect of renamed files.
    - removed some obsolete function declarations:
      line 103: variable()
      line 106: special_char_map_str()

    W_Struct.c:
    - expanded the argument list of new_word().  if the parameter
      copy_from is non-zero it is taken as a source to copy some
      attributes from.
    - took over word_store() function from render.c

    P_Struct.c:
    - in add_paragraph(), replaced malloc of struct word_item by
      new_word().  no function should malloc and init foreign data
      structures by itself but call appropriated functions for that
      because this is a very common source of errors.
    - removed #include <string.h>, was only used for memset().
    - removed #include <gemx.h>, was nowhere used.

    F_Struct.c:
    - new function init_frame() used by new_frame(), reset_frame()
      and temp_frame().  this makes the code a bit shorter and
      decreases the possibility of bugs depending on forgotten
      attribute initializing.
    - removed #include <string.h>, was only used for memset().
    - removed #include <gemx.h>, was nowhere used.

    defs.h:
    - expanded the enum bool to a typedef BOOL.  this makes code a bit
      better readable.  there are also two defines to have earlier code
      still working.

    parser.h, parser.c:
    - return value of get_value() changed to BOOL.

    parser.c:
    - reworked the parse() function to get it more stable with faulty
      html code.  it now uses the scan_tag() and scan_key() functions
      which are already defined in scanner.c (was forgotten in some
      previous patch).

    scanner.h, scanner.c:
    - changed parameter 'lookup' of function scan_key to BOOL.

    render.c:
    - removed a lot of duplicate code in parse_th_tag().  Instead it
      calls now the function parse_td_tag() and does only the few
      things which are different for TH tags in comparsion to TD tags.
    - moved the function word_store() over to W_Struct.c where it
      belongs to more.

    AEI.c:
    - changed full_window(), iconify_window(), uniconify_window() to
      static function type to make gcc happy.
    - outcommented unused GRECT r in uniconify_window().

January 21, 2002

   David Leaver's patches

   addition of #include <dos.h> in loader.c

   version 0.2 finally released

January 18, 2002

   Baldrick's patches

   AEI.C

   new routine full_window(WORD win);  Handles growing\shrinking
     window when the FULLER is clicked

   WM_FULLED case calls full_window();

   new routine iconify_window(WORD win, GRECT *new); handles
     iconifying a window (NO ICON ATM)

   new routine uniconify_window(WORD win, GRECT *new); handles
     uniconifying a window

   WM_ICONIFY and WM_UNICONIFY now supported

   F_STRUCT.C

   added current_table = 0 init's to new_frame(), reset_frame()
     and temp_frame() - fixes random crash after loading a table
     page

   global.h

   added externs for win_status and pre_status

   Loader.C

   set win_status = 0 in init_load()

   modified read_config() line.  It's no longer a test.  I had
     changed it to be an Alert, but found it too annoying atm.

   Highwire.C

   Commented out wind_set(...WF_BEVENT..).  I don't know why it
     was there and no one ever answered the question on the list.
     It also get's rid of not being able to easily retop the Highwire
     window.

   variable.c

   new variable WORD win_status; determines what state our window is
     currently in 0 normal, 1 fulled, 2 iconified

   new variable WORD pre_status; tracks status before iconfication;

January 17, 2002

   John Kromylos Patches

     modifications of load_file() to make TOS happy

     MiNT_Flag moved to top of loader.c

January 16, 2002

   Baldrick's patches

   Applying patches so we can compile a menu version on the fly

   Most notably the inclusion of #ifdef GEM_MENU and Matthias Jaap's
     menu code and RSC file.
   modified files.  Global.h, Highwire.c,AEI.C and Keyinput.c

   AltF4's January 12 patches

   Highwire.c - unused variable numSets commented out

   keyinput.c - variable 'i' commented out, we might want to track
            the return on page_load() at some point in time

   aei.c - moved WM_CLOSED and AP_TERM cases in switch to end of
           switch statement

   scanner.h
     removed the #include, it was only meant for testing.
     scan_color() prototype updated

   scanner.c -
     added #include "token.h" before include "scanner.h"

     added length argument to scan_color().  this way the color
     expression needn't a trailing '\0' anymore.

     removed the #ifndef NULL ... lines, useless.

   values.c
     added #includes for global.h and scanner.h

     removed the #ifndef NULL ... lines, useless.

     added new function Variable_color() which returns directly the
       remapped VDI color value of a given attribute.  this has the
       advantage that we can save some useless copy actions and also
       makes some parse_...() functions a little bit more lean.

   parse.c
     #include section at the begining resorted or a better overview.

     removed a lot of obsolete debug macros (the DBG(..) lines).

     parse_body(), parse_table_tag(), parse_td_tag(), parse_th_tag(),
	  parse_font_tag():
	     modified to use the new Variable_color() function.

     line 1821 - split if statement to keep PureC quiet

     line 1987 - improved recognition of comments, <!--..--> and <!-..->
       are now also working if going over more than one line and if a
       html tag is inside

   AltF4's January 14 patches

     NETLAYER.C
       - added a dummy line to avoid PureC warning 'unused variable'.

     values.c:
       is now renamed to  parser.c  because this matches its meaning
	   much better.

	   the Variable..() functions are renamed now to more descriptive
	   names get_value(), get_value_str(), get_value_color().

	   the function declarations are now placed in the header file
	   parser.h where they belongs.

	   added some explanation comments.

     Parse.c:
       is now renamed to  render.c  because this matches its meaning
       much better.

       removed obsolete Variable..() declarations, is now placed in
       parser.h.  #include "parser.h" added.

       in all functions, replaced the obsolete Variable..() calls by
       the appropriate get_value..() calls (51 times).

     Makefile, purewire.prj, highwire.prj - updated

January 11, 2002

   Baldricks patches

   current_width lines deleted in walk_table_children()

   WORD temp_val added to table_item structure
  	 just a temporary word for use in table calculations I'm using
  	 it for replacing temp_cols at the moment, but made a generic
  	 name in case we find other uses for it.

  walk_chilren and table_width routines adapted to use table_item->temp_val

  current_width determination in percentage width tables moved to
  after walk_children in case sub tables have been processed

  draw_table() adapted to use table->temp_val

  draw_frame_contents() added new parameter frame_item *current_frame

  draw_table() added new parameter frame_item *current_frame

  current_word in draw_table() changed to frame->current_word

  draw_table() parameter 2 now table_item * instead of paragraph_item *

  current_child in draw_table() now refrences current_table->current_child

  draw_table() changed to long return - subtable heights were being lost



January 10, 2002

   AltF4's patches

   PARSE.C  line 15 #include "scanner.h" lower case

   HIGHWIRE.C line 37 \\HTML\\ now lower case \\html\\

   Edited .HTM files for lower case file names

   Baldricks patches

   current_child * moved from frame_item to table_item this will let
    us track multiple children for subtables

   calculate_table_width() modified to use table->current_child instead
   of local variable (this is an intermediary step)

   walk_table_children() modified to use table->current_child instead
   of local variable (this is an intermediary step)

   WORD min_width; added to struct table_child should track the size
    of the largest word in the child (ie child can be no narrower than this value)

   word_store() routine tracks child->min_width if inside of a table

   cleaned out come current_paragraph tracking that did nothing in
     calculation of table_width

   ok trying to reuse frame->current_word in walk_table_children()

   current_width commented out in walk_table_children() it wasn't really
   	used and I'm not certain why it was in there

   sub tables are now parsing partially.  This isn't finished yet.
    however they are at least not crashing.

January 9, 2002

   David Leavers update Lattice Highwire.prj included

   AltF4's patches from the 8th included.  These replace baldricks
     changes for Var_len() and in parse_anchor()

   Baldricks patches

   patches in draw_table() for visual representation of colspan
     finally first and second tables in table1.htm display approximately
     correctly.

January 8, 2002

   AltF4's patches from the 5th

   New Purewire.prj (purec prj file)

   New Makefile

   Patched scanner.c and scanner.h

   new values.c

   Rafal Kawecki patches

   string.h added to F_STRUCT.C, P_STRUCT.C

   baldricks patches

   experimental Var_len() routine in values.c gets the length of
   the value of an attribute to a tag

   patches to parse_anchor() to use Var_len routine

   %width tables now set relative to clip width

   %width table width now checked against the minimum size of
   the table if it's smaller than the minimum size it becomes the
   minimum size.

   in redraws.c in draw_table()  in paragraph code. left_border now
   set to 0 instead of paragraph->left_border. I'm not sure why I did
   that.

   added WORD min_width to table_item

   if table->actual_width > frame_page_width  and table is a percentage
     of the clip area.  frame_page_width is set to table->min_width

January 7, 2002

   Cleaned out lattice #ifdefs since we have all 3 main compilers
   working with GEM.LIB.  Thanks to Ralph Lowinski updating the
   PureC version and David Leaver creating a Lattice version.

January 4, 2002

    Moved *.HTM sample files into HTML folder

    Changed default page in Highwire to point to HTML folder files

    Changed version number to 0.2

January 3, 2002

    AltF4 has rewritten a large portion of the parser.
    He didn't document his changes in a short list and
    there are way too many for me to try and detail while
    still having time to get any programming done.
    Basically it's easiest to say, it's alot faster now.

    Baldrick  Updated PRJ files for Lattice and PureC.

Dec 28, 2001

    AltF4's patches

    PARSE.C

    in parse_th_tag() test for table rows put back in for num_cols modification

    GLOBAL.H

    line 111 remap_color(long value) not remap_color(long *value)

    COLOR.C

    line 68 remap_color(long value) not remap_color(long *value)

    SCANNER.C and SCANNER.H updated

    Baldrick's patches

    These are experiments that might be dumped

    attr_step() struct added to defs.h

    attr_step *current_attr added to frame_item struct

    new_attr() and add_attr() added to parse.c

    attr_list() added to parse.c

    Idea is to break the input area for a tag into a linked
     list of attr_step's to speed parsing

    current_attr init'd to 0 in routines in F_STRUCT.C

    Modified parse_p_tag() and parse_td_tag() to use attr_list routine
      old code kept in #ifdef incase new routines are dropped

Dec 26, 2001

    Modifications to handle compiling with GEM.LIB.

    Removal of GEMParBlk code, it was basically to test
      if the program was running under AES 4.x (atari Multitos)

    added cyan and magenta to the COLORNAME array color
      probably not exact, I just guessed something close

    include osbind.h in AEI.C

    wind_set_str() modification for WF_INFO call in main()

    modfications for identify_AES for GNUC

    Baldrick's patches

    Line 290 in MOUSE_R.C  modified first_frame to current_highlighted_link_frame
      hopefully avoids one of the extraneous redraws

    modified vs_clip()'s in blit_block.  They now turn off old window
      level clipping and then localize it to redraw area

    modified current_height > h test near bottom of draw_table()
      it now checks to see if you are in the last column of a table
      This probably isn't perfect.  But it works for the example
      files

    Matthias Jaap's patches for Gemscript

    baldrick - modified int's in Gemscript support to WORD's

    Header modifications in COLOR.C

    Baldricks patches

    WORD identify_AES(void) added to LOADER.C  this searches the cookie
      jar for the AES.  Hopefully compiles with all of our compilers

    A number of defines to support identify_AES() added to DEFS.H

    WORD AES_type added to main().  This tracks AES type used.  Mostly
      used to detect AES_single atm.

    identify_AES() called to issue appropriate Pdomain().  This is code
      scavenged out of Qdialer.  Hopefully it works appropriately allowing
      single TOS to load files AND compiles under all compilers.

    void walk_table_children() routine created.  It handles the walking
      of a tables children and it's paragraphs to get the table actual_width

	if a td or th has a colspan adjust the table->num_cols by colspan - 1
      to adjust for 1 already added at start of tag processing

Dec 20, 2001

    Baldricks patches

    Added 'v. 0.1' to About Highwire dialog in key_pressed() routine

    WORD ignore_colours added to variable.c
       ignore_colours determines whether color settings in tags
       are parsed or ignored.

    ignore_colours = 1; added to planes < 2 test in main().

    parse_body() checks ignore_colours before parsing color attributes

    parse_font_tag() checks ignore_colours before parsing color attribute

    parse_table_tag() checks ignore_colours before parsing bgcolor attribute
       if ignore colours is 1, then it sets the table backaground to frame background

    parse_th_tag() checks ignore_colours before parsing bgcolor attribute

    parse_td_tag() checks ignore_colours before parsing bgcolor attribute

    output[100] removed from parse_title() routine

    WORD actual_width added to table_item struct.  Tracks real width
	    of table

    Several instances of table_width replaced with actual_width.

    WORD actual_width and WORD actual_height added to table_child
       structure.  Tracks what the real dimensions of the child are.

	tag variable height now parsed in th and td tags

	tag variable width now parsed in th and td tags

	Test made in calculate table height and calculate sub table height to
	   see if the html specified a larger height than the data warrants

	Test made in calculate table width and calculate sub table width to
	   see if the html specified a larger height than the data warrants

    WORD forced_width; removed from table_item structure.  It wasn't needed
       anymore

    cell_spacing and cell_padding reversed.  They had been used backwards previously.

Dec 18, 2001 (morning)

    Alot of experimentation with new table_step routines
      to get them functioning correctly

    minimum_width removed from parse_text and calculate frame

Dec 17, 2001

    rem'd out a test in redraw_frame.  frame->frame.h isn't being properly
      initialized so the test is bad.

    prev_alignment added to parse_p_tag().  This tracks the previous paragraphs
      alignment and sets the new paragraph to this if it is not specifically
      defined.

     * current_paragraph param removed from add_paragraph()

     WORD indent param removed from add_paragraph()

     WORD *minimum_width param removed from add_paragraph()

     add_paragraph() now directly modifies frame->current_paragraph
        no longer returns a value

     modified all instances of add_paragraph() for new params

     set frame->current_word at end of add_paragraph() since

     moved word_store() call in add_paragraph() after empty paragraph test

     temporarily removed empty paragraph test in add_paragraph() I think the
       problem it was trying to cure may be gone now.  I'm not really happy
       with some of the vertical spacing now, but if we use the old test
       we now loose some paragraphs

     parse_div_tag() routine created.  handles DIV tags...

     parse_font_tag() routine created.  handles FONT tags...

Dec 13, 2001

     kill_to_end() replaces some code in closing of Title tag

     struct word_item *current_word moved to frame structure

     parse_hr_tag() reworked again
     parse_ol_tag() reworked...
     parse_li_tag() reworked...
     parse_img_tag() reworked...
     parse_ul_tag() reworked...
     parse_header_tag() reworked...
     parse_anchor() reworked...
     list_marker() reworked using expanded frame structure

     parse_menu_tag() routine created.  parse MENU tags.  Possibly
     could be eliminated and mapped onto parse_ul_tag() routine.

     DIR parsing now just mapped to parse_menu_tag() since they are
     functionally the same and both are deprecated officially

     set_center_text() routine created.  If flag is on new paragraph is centered
       if flag != 1 new paragarph is left justified

       DL, DT, DD.  Flag determines operation mode 1 is start != 1 is end of tag
       type determines type of D tag we are parsing  0 DL 1 DT 2 DD

Dec 12, 2001

     parse_ul_tag() routine created.  Just parses UL tags

     parse_ol_tag() routine created.  Just parses OL tags

     parse_li_tag() routine created.  Just parses LI tags

     list_stack_item *current_list moved to frame structure.

     paragraph_item *current_paragraph moved to frame structure.

     current_indent_distance moved to frame structure.

     current_font_step * moved to frame structure.

     simplifying many of the recently added routines to handle
     a frame item * instead of all the seperate variables

     parse_hr_tag() reworked
     parse_header_tag() reworked
     parse_img_tag() reworked

Dec 11, 2001

     slider_bkg variable added.  Controls color of background of frame
     sliders

     slider_col variable added.  Controls color of slider widgets in frame
     controls

     These were both added to variable.c as a set value.  They are
     modified in highwire.c for monochrome displays.  They should
     either be matched to the system settings or user configurable.

Dec 07, 2001

     modified the y coordinate test in frame location detection in
      in button_clicked() in MOUSE_R.C.  If there was no horizontal
      scroller for the frame the coordinates for the frame clip were
      too large.  So the test could find the frame above or to the
      left of the frame you were trying to manipulate.

     Also modified the tests for the x coordinate in the same location
      in a similar manner.

     Note it's very possible that these tests could be rewritten into
      something that would process faster if we think it's necessary.

     parse_img() now retrieves the SRC value and stores it in the
       local variable img_file[];  The way the names are stored for
       framesets and images should probably be modified to avoid
       overflow.  Especially if we are looking at URI's since these
       can exceed 1000 characters.

Dec 06, 2001

	parse_title() now it place.  Handles parsing and conversion
      of title tags to a GEM window compatible formats and then
      sets the window title.

	some modifications in IMG location in table height and redraws

	Setting of col_widths for tables done now when a column is
	of a fixed width.

Dec 05, 2001

    parse_img_tag() routine in place.  Handles the parsing of IMG
      tags to the extant of the current code.

    parse_hr_tag() routine in place.  parse hr tags.


Dec 04, 2001

    modification to set_pre_font() to enable one routine to set and turn off
    set_font_bold() routine created.  Modifies current word styles Bold on and off
    set_font_italic() routine created.  Modifies current word styles Italic on and off
    set_font_strike() routine created.  Modifies current word styles
     Strike on and off
    set_font_underlined() routine created.  Modifies current word styles Underlined
     on and off

    That's all of the simple text manipulations for reuse elsewhere.

Dec 03, 2001

    Put handling for closing td, th and tr tags into parse.c

    TH cells are now bold and centered by default

    parse_body() routine created.  Simply handles the processing
     of body tags.

    Documented more of the supported tags in parse.c

    parse_anchor() routine created.  Parses <A ...> tags.

    set_pre_font() routine created.  Basically 2 lines of common
    code use in a number of locations.

    Why all the new routines?
       Well I'm trying to strip down the reuseable code as much
       as possible so that I can expand the table parsing code.

Dec 01, 2001

	Found and fixed a bug in variable() that did not appear under
	MagicPC.

	Found a bug in calculate table height where I had current_paragraph
	instead of current_table

	moved current_paragraph assignment to top of while loops in calc height
	and width of tables. ooops.

	Some cleanup and moving of stuff around in the table calculation
	routines.

	added some word_stores in the child creation.

	modified highwire to load highwire.htm by default

Nov 30, 2001

	Fixed a bug in border watching that basically forced tables
	not to print.

	Ok.  Simple tables are mostly working.  There are problems
	and limitations still.  However I did promise to give everyone
	a look.

	Clickable areas in tables aren't working properly.  Lookups
	in tables are failing as well.

	Some table cells have improper sizes.

	ie.  This isn't finished, it's just for show and to get other
	people who might be looking at the code a look at the table
	code.

Nov 29, 2001

    draw_box() routine created to draw the bounding boxes around
    items like tables.

Nov 28, 2001

	Ok there was very litle tracking in the history for awhile
	alot of things were done to the code and for along time it
	was like walking in a dark tunnel with nothing but a broken
	flashlight.  However finally simple tables are working to
	a limited extant.

Nov. 13, 2001

	Patches patches everywhere.
	Finally partial success on simple tables without defined widths


October 31, 2001

	Ok, I'm giving up on the clickable object bug right now.  several
	 days of work and no success.  The location of the window on the
	 desktop does affect this bug.

October 30, 2001

	more experimentation involving the mislocation of clickable areas in
	tables.

October 29, 2001

	getting back into the code after a forced break... sorry about that
	numerous problems with tables.  Much experimentation.

October 17, 2001

   numerous modifications to fix clickable_area's inside of tables

   fixed default alignment in table data cells

October 11, 2001

	Several patches by Mathias Japp

	parse_colour() rewritten using an array

	special_char_map_str() rewritten using array

   	parse_header_tag() modified with strupr

   	keyinput.c - new defines at top

   	New Hot Keys

   	Control O - Open file selector

   	Contorl I - About Highwire alert

   	Control Q - Quit Highwire

   	New routines

   	page_load() support for Fileselector

   	build_fname()  build filename - support for Fileselector

September 27, 2001

   restart of implementation of table support

   table_item() and table_child() structs placed back
     into defs.h (table_item * put back into paragraph)

   Table parsing in parse.c reimplemented (it still needs work)

   Start of reimplementation of table rendering

September 26, 2001

   some experiments in the redraw code, nothing really

Took a few days off.

September 21, 2001

   fixed lockup problem on resizing window. Missed the equal to in
     the tests.

September 20, 2001

   added clipping_area struct to the paragraph structure.  This
     will be used in the redraw code to identify if a paragraph
     needs to be redraw in relation to the new viewport.
   added initialization of clipping area to calculate_frame_height()

   experiments with a new draw_frame_contents routine using the
     paragraph areas.  It's mostly working.  However many advantages
     from the old system are currently missing.

   alot of modification to calculate_frame_height() to get the
     objects area's correct.

September 19, 2001

	draw_hr() routine created.  First fully functional part of a
	  modular redraw system.
	draw_img() routine created. Second functional part of modular
	  redraw.  Note IMG routines do not handle images yet, they
	  are mearly holders for future use.
    added an extra test to compare the height to the frame height
      this was to help exit the routine when it had drawn everything
      that it had to draw.
    modified d_up etc. in blit_block to use pts[3] for the
      frame_h on the redraw.  This simplifies some things and
      apparently breaks nothing.  I did this since draw_frame_contents
      was drawing past the end of the window (I turned clip off and
      discovered this). No sense in wasted processing.
	draw_paragraph() routine created. Third functional part of modular
	  redraw :)

September 17, 2001

    More digging in the guts of the redraw code.  Something
    dreadfully wrong going on somewhere.

    Ok I did a reset of the code back to the sept 7 version
    with some additions made on September 10th.  Hopefully
    from here I'll be able to see the way forward again.

    variable() and HR patches reimplemented

September 14 & 13, 2001

	Very litle time either day for programming.
	Mostly experimentations for a new method of drawing
	the frame contents.

September 12, 2001

	current_table pointer addition to parse html
	<tr> increments table->row counter
	<table> handles alignment, bgcolor, border, cell_padding,
	     cell_padding, width
	<td> handles bgcolor

September 11, 2001

   more modifications to handle new table structures

   first parsing of data to new table structures

September 10, 2001

   variable() patched again.  We need to parse out LF and CR.  It
   appears that MS considers it legal to place them inside of a
   tag.

   modification to HR parsing, if there is no width the width
   is set to -100 (or 100%)

   modification in redraw to handle new HR parsing.  Basically its
   back to the original with some care to avoid overflows

   table_item() structure work started
   table_child() structure work started
   table.c  file added to project

September 7, 2001

   frame_name added to frame structure and load_to_do item

   NAME parsed in frameset parsing code in PARSE.C

   target added to url_link structure.

   new_url_link() added target parameter

September 6, 2001

   fixed two more integer overflow bugs in f_calc.c

   implemented suggestion by Deun for handling integer overflow problem.

   implemented a method for adding 1 to frames to fill space
   Probably could be done better, but I don't have any manuals here.

   Also NOTE we really need to think about how to inform later frames
   that their x has moved by one.

   renamed this file to HISTORY.TXT

   Changed clipping area y to WORD from long.  Did some casts to WORD
   and other modifications to support this change.

   Changed clickable area y to WORD from long.  Support casts to WORD
   and other modifications necessary done.

   Found another overflowing integer in the scroll widget size determination
   fixed vertical and horizontal.  So scoll bars are working properly now.

September 5, 2001

   trashed image as word item experiments

   New routine parse_text()  for handling ordinary text files
   like this one.

   new Routine get_decoder_type() for determining the appropriate
   decoder for a file based on it's extension.

   Modifications of parse_to_do item and add_parse_to_do to handle
   the decoder type extension

   Modified the size of several buffers in parse.c, the reason was
   we were over flowing them.  This would be a good area to investigate
   alternatives.

   patched draw_frame_contents to watch for right border not allowing
   words to fit

   border now parsed in parse_frameset (well used now at least)

   modifications in calculate frames.  We were overflowing the buffer
   if our framesize was a percentage and getting erroneous results


September 4, 2001
   experiments with making images a word item...

August 31, 2001

Not perfect but the blocks for the images are at least partially
working.  It needs some improvement which might involve some major
shifting around in the code.  But most of the time it works without
locking up.
Mikes patches for lattice window title code in place.

August 30, 2001

changed default output in special_char_map_str() to Space_Code
modified strike out display location in draw_frame_contents from
 divided by 3 to divided by 2

August 29, 2001

I had missed Fuchsia in the parse_color() routine.

August 28, 2001

experiments with <IMG>
addition of img to enum for paragraph types (can we put it here)
Updates to char 10 parsing

August 26, 2001

Catch char 10 (line feeds) in parsing
Paragraphs now default left (was failing sometimes)
blockquote support

August 25, 2001

Modified parse_header_tag to take current_word as a parameter

August 24, 2001

removed a couple of now useless tests for " on return from variable()

August 23, 2001

New file CONFIG.C
   reads and parses a config file

Hopefully config file is self explanatory for the moment

Slight Warning...  Somethings are a bit strange since I
decided to rework the variable routine.  ie.  somethings
that did work fail.  I'm slowly tracking these down.  The
new code, basically lets us get rid of a bunch of silly tests
that were elsewhere in the code.

August 22, 2001

...patches for variable() routine to parse out begining "
and trailing " and spaces.
This will probably involve alot more patching as we go on.

Modifications to the parse_color routine

August 21, 2001

Added WORD text_colour and link_colour to frame struct

modifications in redraw and parsing to handle new color indexs

August 20, 2001

New routine to parse header tags.  Just cleans up alot of duplicated
	code in the main parse routine.

New routine parse_colour()
	used to map "white" etc to appropriate VDI index

Support for parse_colour in a few places

Moved background_colour from a define to a WORD /* probably should dump it? */

Removed new_frame pointer from frame struct

Added WORD background_colour to frame struct

Modified redraw routines to handle frame->background_colour

New file "color.c"  handles color mapping, palette storing etc.

August 14, 2001

   Added support for border in add_load_to_do() call
   had to modify calculate frame again
   Success finally
   removed container value from frame structure
   added init_paths() to preload last_location for
   filename searching.

   Warning, there is probably junk I've inserted into the code
   while working out framesets to this point, that do not really
   get used.  Sorry about that, we will just have to watch and
   play cleanup.

   ALSO there are some serious redraw problems with multiple
   frames.  I haven't sorted these out yet.  I don't think it
   has anything to do with the frameset parsing.  I think there
   are just some bad tests somewhere in the code.

August 10, 2001

    Frameset parsing moving along.
    Added container value to frame structure, if true then redraw
    etc doesn't worry about this frames contents.
    Modified calculate_frame to take frame_item *

August 8, 2001

Still more modifications of frame routines.

Creation of previous_frame *, this points to the last created
	frame.  So when we create a new frame we have a standard place
	to put it in the list.

August 3, 2001

	Hey found part of what I was looking for.
	frame_left controls the offset of the frame into the window
	now I can really start to get closer on the multiple frames
	in pages.

	history file lost stuff, did alot of things that went no where.
	Into the code and back out again.  Howver the following have
	been done recently.

	init_load() routine modified.  Basically alot didn't need to
	be there.

	some code cleanups.  However Lattice compiles now not working
	100% :<

July 31, 2001

	experiments with cur_frame and frame_list to no end

July 30, 2001

JUNKED ... started the construction of page_item() to handle all the frame_items
	for a page.  Just a higher level container basically so that
	the frame_items can be dynamic and not static.

modifications to  <font size = 2> code and <\font> code
	however not alot.  I'm not certain how to really fix this.
	The problem we have is that sometimes fonts become way!!!! too small.
	Really the code works probably about the way it should except we end
	up with font sizes of 4 and smaller.  Too small for most to read.

modified variable() routine again.  stptok() in one instance, replaced
	by strchr()

July 20, 2001

changed 'noshade' check to != '!' instead of '*' since if there is another
	variable after the NOSHADE there will be a value in out

heavy modifications to variable() routine.  I discovered it had some
	bleeding values creeping in.  Also replaced all strrchr() with stptok()

July 19, 2001

Changed current_word->vertical_align = middle; from bottom in end
	of <sub sup> processing.  Old method dropped it too low.

Fixed a missing space in TEST2.HTML ;)

default height spacer in redraw frame is now line_tail (not perfect but
	makes sub sup tags happier, in effect all text was drawn below the
	baseline in the past.

Extra check in ISO processing '& ' is not processed but dumped straight
	as it is shown.

Modified iso character processing for strings to take a conversion type
	0 gives you the ISO Latin conversions
	1 gives you Atari Ascii conversions (where existing)
	This allowed me to get the ISO char codes working for the window title.

changed default height spacer in vertical alignment (redraw frame) to line_tail

July 18, 2001

Finished up &szlig; style ISO entity processing.  Should have all
	the standard ones in place now.

<Hx> tags are now made bold.  I believe this is the standard practice

added space_found = false; to ISO processing

July 16, 2001

First off sorry about the bad archive (missing files + bad filenames)
on the 15th of July

Modification of init_load() routine.  Now sets window title to
<file> in case we don't get a title later on.

additional special char support (new routine, new processing)
   It's not completely finished however and parts that are done
   are not correct

<title> code modified again. \r and \n caught in while() loop now.

July 15, 2001

slash conversion on local file names / to \

<pre> <\pre> partial initial support. (still has some problems)

July 14, 2001

found vs_clip() problem on TT with Nova card and NVDI

July 13, 2001

<hr> code modified in parsing routines so that changed.font = TRUE
seems to fix some of the problems with text display after a <hr SIZE x>
tag

<hr> code modified in redrawing routines so that <hr> covers the width
of the frame unless it has a defined width.

removed second current_paragraph->paragraph_code = hr in <hr> parsing

<br> modifications to reduce excess space that were added sometimes
	   added a changed.font = TRUE


July 12, 2001
