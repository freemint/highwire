<h2>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</h2>
<hr>
<p><b><i>Welcome to the latest release of HighWire, 0.1.6!</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I write this Developer letter it struck me that this is
our 3rd Christmas release!&nbsp; In the past three years much has happened with
the HighWire code.&nbsp; Countless hours have been spent working on this
project, not to mention all the coffee, soda and oyster cookies.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;I'd like to take a moment to thank one person behind a lot of those
hours of coding, AltF4. Without his dedication, HighWire would NOT be what it is
today.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the cheering for AltF4 has gone down a few decibels.
Besides the normal bug fixes, what's new with HighWire?&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  <p>The cache system has been reworked, cached files will now be used over subsequent sessions.
  The reload button performs a&nbsp; reload of online pages, not only a reparse
  from the cache. Implemented basic CSS support for BIG, SMALL,  FONT, SUB, SUP, H1..6, P, DD, DT,
  DD and SPAN tags. Parsing of &lt;STYLE> areas. Pop-ups are now aligned always to the screen
  extents. Meta tag 'http-equiv=expires' implemented</p>
  <p>For more details see the <a href="Change.Log">Change.Log</a> file.
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for another repeat, Baldrick's call for volunteers. 
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in helping with the HighWire project,
  don't hesitate to get in touch with any member of the development team and let
  them know. There are lots of areas where more people would make the job
  easier. If you can't program, then consider helping with the documentation or
  get involved with submitting bug reports. If you are a programmer and are
  interested in working on the code of HighWire, then definitely get in contact
  with the development team. Many sections of the code can seem quite confusing
  without knowing how some of the basics of the code works. There are also
  libraries that are needed to compile the code now that you can get from the
  development list. Translations into other languages would also be a nice
  addition to the project. While we have many different languages spoken by
  members of the development team, we only have language support for French and
  English.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is a modern browser needed for our platform. It is our
  belief that our best option is one that is native and open source. By native
  we mean something that was written with our machines in mind and Open Source
  so that we never have to worry about a programmer deciding to stop
  development. Even if the whole development team were to quit tomorrow the code
  would still be available and waiting for someone else to continue on the work.
  We believe that HighWire can fill this role. This technology is open source,
  so hopefully with your support it can be the core to many projects on our
  platform. Not the least of which will be in the future a fully modern web
  browser. To reach that goal we will need time and the help of community.</p>
