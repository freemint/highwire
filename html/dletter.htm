<H4>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</H4>
<HR>
<P><B><I>Welcome to HighWire 0.1.0!</I></B></P>
<blockquote>
The time has come, the Walrus said,<br>
To speak of many things:<br>
Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax <br>
Of cabbages - and kings <br>
And why the sea is boiling hot <br>
And whether pigs have wings.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<i>from 'The Walrus and the Carpenter'<br>
a poem by Lewis Carol<br>
from Through the Looking Glass, <br>
sequel of Alice in Wonderland. </i><br>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I write this, the Christmas season is in full swing and a
bit of levity is in the air.  So I started with a quote from one of my 
favourite poems.  While in the poem the Walrus and Carpenter are attempting
to distract the poor oysters as they devour them (No not Oyster Cookies Rob),
we are using it to announce version 0.1.0 of HighWire and to reflect on some
of the <i>'shoes and ships and sealing wax'</i> that have occured in it's
development over the last year.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Christmas Eve a year ago, version 0.0.1 of the HighWire
project was announced in the newsgroups.  At that point many did question
whether this 'pig had wings'. It's tag support was somewhat limited, only
simple tables worked properly and sometimes it was easier to see what was
wrong with the program than what was right.  However, there were a few
things that were right about it, Open Source, Free and it gave us a new 
glimmer of hope.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the year progressed, we have seen numerous improvements
all around the project.  Image support in the form of Gif's was added. 
Image alignments were implemented. Table support was completely rewritten
and aside from a few small glitches is working quite nicely.  Text can be 
floated around Images and Tables.  Unicode support with 9 user selectable
encodings was included. Frame scrolling, Wheel mouse support and of course
who could ignore TTF support.  This is only a small part of the progress,
considering everything that has been accomplished, It has been a good year.</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in this version, we officially announce the 'unofficial'
online support.  It's not finished, so it's 'unofficial' still.  However 
numerous of the recent changes have increased it's useability.  So if you 
are feeling like a bit of an adventure, go online and see where you can go.
Among the changes that were added to improve online use were the per window history
function, which tracks the history of each individual window, and the partial
FORM support.  The &ltinput&gt buttons are fully funtional now, eg. in the
'about:cache' listing they are used to remove cached items.  For online use
all of the implemented elements are fully working for method 'GET'.  But text
fields can't be edited yet, so only empty or default values are sent.  A few of
the other changes, were the completion of Unicode support and work that makes it
easier to use the HighWire engine in other programs (see the new Dr Who Quiz 
program by M. Jaap).  With all of this, we topped it off with another major
round of optimizations and bug fixes.  Hopefully you will find this to be a 
satisfying update.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in helping with the HighWire project, don't
hesitate to get in touch with any member of the development team and let them
know. There are lots of areas where more people would make the job easier. If
you can't program, then consider helping with the documentation or get involved
with submitting bug reports. If you are a programmer and are interested in
working on the code of HighWire, then definitely get in contact with the
development team. Many sections of the code can seem quite confusing without
knowing how some of the basics of the code works. There are also libraries that
are needed to compile the code now that you can get from the development list.
Translations into other languages would also be a nice addition to the project.
While we have many different languages spoken by members of the development
team, we only have language support for French and English.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is a modern browser needed for our platform. It is our
belief that our best option is one that is native and open source. By native we
mean something that was written with our machines in mind and Open source so
that we never have to worry about a programmer deciding to stop development.
Even if the whole development team were to quit tomorrow the code would still be
available and waiting for someone else to continue on the work. We believe that
HighWire can fill this role. While currently it should not really be classified
as a browser, but more of a demonstration of a parsing and rendering engine.
This technology is open source, so hopefully with your support it can be the
core to many projects on our platform. Not the least of which will be in the
future a fully modern web browser. To reach that goal we will need time and the
help of community.</P>

<P>With all of that in mind, we hope you see the glass as half full and not half
empty. Look at what it can do. If you find applications for it's use all the
better. Also before you are too harsh in your judgments or compare it to other
browsers too harshly. Consider that maybe it is only fair to compare HighWire to
other Open Source HTML parsers on the Atari platform. HighWire's code is not
locked up on someone's machine. You didn't have to pay anything to experiment
with it. And instead of telling you that something can't be done, we are
actively encouraging you to help prove it can be done.</P>
