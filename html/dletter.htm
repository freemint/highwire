            <h3>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><b><i>Welcome to the latest release of HighWire, version
0.2.6</i></b></p>

            <p>It has been several months since the last public release
and for that
we are sorry. Between real world concerns eating up our time
and some very tricky to find bugs, this version has taken us much
longer to put together than any of us would have wished. However
the long process was not without results. Several low level problems
have been eliminated and a number of new features have been
implemented. We hope that you will find this version to be an enjoyable
improvement over the last version, and we promise that the
next release will not take as long to get together as this version.
            </p>
