<H2>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</H2>
<HR>
<P><B><I> Welcome to the latest release of HighWire, 0.1.2!</I></B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a while since the
last official release of HighWire back in January, but development hasn't
stopped. If you are ever looking for the latest information on the
development status of the project, please stop by the HighWire web site.
You can also post a comment in our
<a href="http://www.atariforums.com/index.php?f=20" target="_blank">forum</A>
for discussions on HighWire, Good or Bad!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The team would like to take a moment to thank everyone who voted for
HighWire in the MyAtari awards, the support  is appreciated. We would
also like to congratulate the other award winners.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's get right to the question. What has been improved in the 0.1.2
release of HighWire you ask? Well, the first visible update to HighWire
is the addition of the navigation bar with the traditional browser
buttons Forward, Back, Home, Reload, Stop and the URL edit field.  A nice
feature of the Forward and Back buttons is when holding them a bit
longer, a popup appears for selecting not only the last or next page, but
also every URL that is stored in history. The navigation bar can also be
hidden or shown by holding down the ALT key while clicking the window's
close button.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Online support is still "Unofficial", but initial implementation of the
Ovl's for different TCP/IP stack support  has been added, see the directory
'modules and read the <a href="../modules/README.TXT">README.TXT file</a>.
Form support has also been improved with the support of Selection List. Other
improvements in the handling of frame sets, frames can now be resized.
Calculation of the width of tables and cells has also been improved. Not
to mention the many other bug fixes, updates made to HighWire.  For the
full list of changes in this release,  you can read them in the
<a href="../Change.Log">Change.Log</a> file included in the archive.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team "Captain" Baldrick did an outstanding job writing this next part
in the last release, I thought it should also be included in this version
of the developer letter. (I also added some oyster cookies for Baldrick
and Gokmase to munch on while reading.)

<blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in helping with the HighWire project, don't
hesitate to get in touch with any member of the development team and let them
know. There are lots of areas where more people would make the job easier. If
you can't program, then consider helping with the documentation or get involved
with submitting bug reports. If you are a programmer and are interested in
working on the code of HighWire, then definitely get in contact with the
development team. Many sections of the code can seem quite confusing without
knowing how some of the basics of the code works. There are also libraries that
are needed to compile the code now that you can get from the development list.
Translations into other languages would also be a nice addition to the project.
While we have many different languages spoken by members of the development
team, we only have language support for French and English.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is a modern browser needed for our platform. It is our
belief that our best option is one that is native and open source. By native we
mean something that was written with our machines in mind and Open source so
that we never have to worry about a programmer deciding to stop development.
Even if the whole development team were to quit tomorrow the code would still be
available and waiting for someone else to continue on the work. We believe that
HighWire can fill this role. While currently it should not really be classified
as a browser, but more of a demonstration of a parsing and rendering engine.
This technology is open source, so hopefully with your support it can be the
core to many projects on our platform. Not the least of which will be in the
future a fully modern web browser. To reach that goal we will need time and the
help of community.</P>
