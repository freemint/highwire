<h2>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</h2>
<hr>
<p><b><i>Welcome to the latest release of HighWire, <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">0.1.8!(?)</span></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Changes:
</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Pop-up menu with Save As... and Copy URL added <br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;&lt;TEXTAREA&gt; tag implemented.&nbsp; The length of the
typed in text is restricted only by the system RAM&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Keyboard input implemented for form tags of the type
&lt;INPUT type=text ..&gt;.&nbsp; Jumping to other text fields of a
formular can be done by the TAB key, inclusive automatical page
scrolling to the reached field.&nbsp; Leaving the edit mode can be done
with CTRL+TAB.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Table column width calculation changed, was causing
crashes sometimes.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Speed up CSS parsing by avoiding useless CSS
interpretation for closing tags, saves up to 20% parsing time on some
sites.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Cache improved to avoid storing of contents resulting
from POST actions.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Handling of form method POST implemented.</li>
  </ul>

call for volunteers. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in helping with the HighWire
project, don't hesitate to get in touch with any member of the
development team and let them know. There are lots of areas where more
people would make the job easier. If you can't program, then consider
helping with the documentation or get involved with submitting bug
reports. If you are a programmer and are interested in working on the
code of HighWire, then definitely get in contact with the development
team. Many sections of the code can seem quite confusing without
knowing how some of the basics of the code works. There are also
libraries that are needed to compile the code now that you can get from
the development list. Translations into other languages would also be a
nice addition to the project. While we have many different languages
spoken by members of the development team, we only have language
support for French and English.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is a modern browser needed for our platform.
It is our belief that our best option is one that is native and open
source. By native we mean something that was written with our machines
in mind and Open Source so that we never have to worry about a
programmer deciding to stop development. Even if the whole development
team were to quit tomorrow the code would still be available and
waiting for someone else to continue on the work. We believe that
HighWire can fill this role. This technology is open source, so
hopefully with your support it can be the core to many projects on our
platform. Not the least of which will be in the future a fully modern
web browser. To reach that goal we will need time and the help of
community.</p>
