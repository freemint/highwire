- Multiple Windows are now supported for the
  frame target "_blank".  Also ALT+ mouse
  click on a link opens it in a new window.

  now so far.  The result isn't that pretty
  yet but at least useable.

- Highlighting of links improved.  If the
  mouse pointer is over a link the target

  <tag key='attribute'> quotation.

- Overworked text floating around images and
  tables.

Changes in V.07 alpha  of July 24, 2002:

- Reworked configuration code, new keyword
  FONT_SIZE in the cfg file sets the base
  font size in point (default is 12pt).  If
  the environment variable HOME is set the
  cfg file will first be searched at the
  places  $HOME/defaults/highwire.cfg ->
  $HOME/highwire.cfg -> $HOME/.highwire .

- Improved handling of text wrapping around
  images and tables, also <br clear> flag is
  handled now.

- Implemented HSPACE image attributes.

- Frame targets _top, _self, _parent are
  recognized properly now (_blank still not
  working).

  implemented now (default is 5px).

- <HR> tags are now correctly calculated in
  position and size.

  STYLE of some HTML tags.

- For <H1>..<H6> and <HR> the color and the
  background-color can be set with the CSS
  style attribute.

- Reworked parser and text storing code for
  faster parsing and reduced memory usage.

- Lots of smaller glitches fixed.

Changes in V.06 alpha  of July 07, 2002:

- Bugfix in the GIF image reading function.
  Due to a miscalculated value for vertical
  scaling this function could cause crashes
  by corrupting memory.

- First implementation of text wrapping
  around images that have ALIGN="LEFT" set.

- Implementation of the VSPACE attribute for
  images.

- Links to target frame "_top" are working
  correctly now.

- Fixed drawing of table background and cell
  borders.

- Fixed redraw bug if the window was covered
  by other windows.

- Scrolling works now also if the window is
  not the top window (without topping it).

- If a file type can't be determined by the
  file's extension a simple check is done to
  see if the file contains HTML (eg. for php
  extension).

- Added handling of 'about:' and 'mailto:'.
