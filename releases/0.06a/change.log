Changes in V.06 alpha   (since V.05):

- Bugfix in the GIF image reading function.
  Due to a miscalculated value for vertical
  scaling this function could cause crashes
  by corrupting memory.

- First implementation of text wrapping
  around images that have ALIGN="LEFT" set.

- Implementation of the VSPACE attribute for
  images.

- Links to target frame "_top" are working
  correctly now.

- Fixed drawing of table background and cell
  borders.

- Fixed redraw bug if the window was covered
  by other windows.

- Scrolling works now also if the window is
  not the top window (without topping it).

- If a file type can't be determined by the
  file's extension a simple check is done to
  see if the file contains HTML (eg. for php
  extension).

- Added handling of 'about:' and 'mailto:'.
