2. What is HighWire?

This is taken from the HighWire site written by the original author, 
Robert Goldsmith.

"For those of you who have not heard, HighWire is a new web browser. It has
been in 'development' for over a year. I started HighWire in what I 
considered a feeble attempt to discourage me from moaning about Cab. I 
figured that when I proved my code was vastly slower than Cab at parsing and
rendering a page I would give up and accept that browsing on my Falcon would
always be slow.  Things did not turn out how I expected... I think the big
problem with my plan was that, unbeknownst to me at the time, I had had a
couple of rather good ideas.  The result is HighWire. Ok, so can I download
it?  You cannot write a web browser in a month. I know, I tried :) HighWire
is still very much in development. "
 
Originally HighWire could do the following:

  ù Load in an HTML 3.2 page hard coded into the source
  ù Display this page multiple times in hard coded frames
  ù Redraw and scroll the frames and resize the window
  ù Quit
 
Where we have gone with the project ...

New items since it went open source:

 ù Frameset Support (90%)
 ù Tables (98%)
 ù HTML 4 compliant (90%)
 ù HTML forms (20%)  ù Online OVLs for mintnet, sting and support for iconnect
 ù Colour support (mapped to current system palette)
 ù Graphics (99%) - Now loads HTML files with Gifs, Jpgs, XBM, XPM and Pngs 
   (50%) - colours are now perfect in all color modes 
   (mono/256/32k/64k/24bit/32bit) which were tested using a Hades060 with a 
   Nova graphics card. May solve color problems on a Falcon with a Nova card 
   but this has not been tested as yet.
 ù Files (Graphics, HTMLs, Docs etc.) can be dragged to a Highwire window 
   where they will be displayed
 ù Implementation of memory caching of images avoids multiple loading of the 
   same image. The pseudo URI "about:cache" now shows detailed information 
   about cached images.
 ù Gem Version with drop-down menues
 ù Gemscript support
 ù Iconify/Uniconify window
 ù HighWire now loads sample HTM files from a folder named "HTML"
 ù Sound support
 ù International Character Set support
 ù Unicode characters up to U+FFFD with NVDI 4 and TrueType fonts
 ù Scroll Window using arrow keys
 ù A working implementation of hyperlinks (text and image)
 ù File Selector support
 ù Display text files using PRE style font selection
 ù Number of windows only restricted by operating system
 ù Frame Scroll controls are implemented now, also support of right mouse
   button.
 ù Real time scrolling
 ù Background Scrolling is now working
 ù Highwire now works with scroll mice when the program MWheel is being used.
 ù The program MyPDF has been added to the HighWire package and is currently
   under development (PDF support 10%)
 ù Several Hotkeys added ù Extended menu bar, the current charset encoding 
   can be seen and changed at menu title "View". Also de/increasing of the 
   display font is available there.
 ù Menu entry"Info.." will show now some basic information about the active 
   frame.
 ù Improved algorithm for line breaking to avoid splitting of text lines at 
   wrong positions.
 ù HTTP protocol layer reworked, is much faster now and works for much more 
   servers.
 ù The problem of files with long names not loaded at some Magic versions 
   (eg. *.html) is solved now.
 ù Added a workaround to have it working under Geneva again.
 ù Reworked code to avoid a flickering mouse pointer when using Highwire.
 ù Navigational Bar added with the traditional browser button: Forward, Back,
   Home, Reload, Stop and URL Edit Field.
 ù When holding down the Forward and Back buttons a bit longer, a popup 
   appears allows selection of any URL in History as well as the Last and 
   Next URLs..
 ù Using the commands, ^C/^V, copying between the Navigation Bar's edit field 
   and the Clipboard can be done.
 ù The Navigation Bar can be hidden or shown by holding down the ALT key while
   the window's Close Button.
 ù Initial implementation of the Ovl's for different TCP/IP stack support has
   been added.
 ù Form support added which allow keyboard input into form input fields.
 ù Calculation of table width and cells have been improved.
 ù New keyword FONT_MINSIZE to define a minimum font height in points, eg. for
   (font size = 1) (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for explanation).
 ù New menu entry under "Options" to have frames always resizable and 
   scrollbars if necessary even if the HTML defines anything else there. The
   default is off, but can be set with the keyword FORCE_FRAMECTRL = 1 in the
   config file.
 ù The cfg file now supports three new keywords concerning the cache:  1) 
   CACHEDIR which lets the user choose where Highwire will define a directory 
   for the storage of visited pages/images, 2) CACHEMEM = (kbytes) to limit 
   the amount of memory cached images (default is now 100k) which should help 
   to prevent Highwire from running out of memory due to always storing every 
   image ever loaded and 3) CACHEDSK which sets limits for filling up the 
   cache in order to prevent blowing up hard drives. (eg. CACHEDSK = 8192 
   1000 means to use only 8192 of disk space, but not more than 1000 files).
 ù More funtionality for the redo buttion: Holding down the ALT key clears 
   now the whole cache. Additional holding down the SHIFT key will avoid 
   forcing a page reload then.
 ù The TAB key can now be used to jump between text fields, inluding 
   autmatical page scrolling to the actual field -- the latter in opposite to 
   CAB. To leave the edit mode either press CTRL+TAB or click somewhere else
   on the page.
 ù A right mouse click not only brings up the options: Back, Forward, Reload, 
   View Source and Info, but also Copy URL and Save As. This means that now 
   it is possible to download archive and HTML files to a local directory.
 ù TEXTAREA tags are now working and editable.
 ù Highwire is now capable of storing non-session cookies to allow persistent 
   user preferences for sites, as offered by Google, Yahoo and others. Access 
   this "Options" menu.
 ù When the option 'Cookies allowed' in the menu gets changed, this will be 
   stored in the config file.
 ù F10 brings up full-screen mode.
 ù New keyword for the Highwire cfg file. START_PAGE = <url or file> to define 
   what be displayed after program start. NOTE: This option will always be 
   ignored at the very first start of a new installed version.
 ù The menu bar got changed: 'Suppress Images' was removed (still useable from 
   config file) and instead 'View Images' and 'Use CSS' were added. Both of 
   the latter are stored in the cfg file also when changed.
 ù Highwire now has CSS support especially for the layout of the floating 
   block elements (DIV, TABLE, P, ..). Also recognized are the CSS attributes: 
   float, clear, border and font.
 ù Highwire now loads it's config file from the HOME directory under Magic and 
   Mint.

It is currently missing:

  ù user interface
  ù Java/JavaScript support
  ù use of internet clients
  ù External viewer support
  ù External emailer
  ù lots more...
 
So why all the fuss?

Well, HighWire can load in, parse and render an HTML page in full 16-bit
fonts (for all the 'strange' characters such as Thorn) in about half the time
of Cab. Furthermore, once a page is pre-rendered (before the first time it
is displayed) it does not need further processing, making redraws and
window resizes much much faster. On a Hades machine the code was tested
on, the page render including font sizes, centering and lists redrew
correctly in real time (with a slight flicker...) as the window was
resized.

File types supported:

  ù HTML files (8-bit coded)
  ù GIF images
  ù JPG images
  ù PNG images (not yet complete: no interlaced pics at the moment)
  ù Plain text (8-bit and 16-bit coded)

Configuration:

  ù At present highwire.cfg consists mainly of font information. Change
    manually, or better with the setup tool FontList. 


5. Use of FontList

FontList - Coded by Lp and GokMasE for HighWire project
========

Small utility to change font settings in HighWire configuration file.

* Installation

Keep this binary in the work directory of HighWire.

* Useage

As of FontList 1.11 a default config file is created at launch time,
unless an existing file is located in FontList's work directory.
Also note that if the font setting you are seeking to change is not
present (or not activated) in the old config file, FontList will add
the new setting to the end of the config.

Select 1 (there can be only one) of the fonts, then use
menubar to decide what setting in HighWire should be affected.
You can also right click on any of the fonts to open up a popup menu 
and select a text style to link the current font ID to.
Note that changes are written to HighWire configuration file
instantly when you select an entry in either menu!

Another thing you can do, is select a number of fonts (hold down 
CTRL) and later press CTRL+C. Then the prg will save a list of all 
currently selected fonts to the clipboard.

CTRL+A selects/deselects all.

NOTE: When NVDI is installed, all non-speedo fonts are greyed out and 
thus not selectable. The reason for this is that HighWire at this time 
does not support other format than Speedo. However, if you wish to 
play around with other fonts you can enable all listed fonts by 
selecting "Allow non-speedo" from menubar.

* General advice

While this tools seems to work pretty reliable, it is a good idea to 
keep backups of the configuration file.
