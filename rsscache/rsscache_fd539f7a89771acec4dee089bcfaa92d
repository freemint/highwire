If the hotlist is the topped window and i click on &quot;Open file&quot; (folder icon in non-topped main window),<br />
fileselector opens correct, but the selected file is opened in hotlist window then.<br />

<br />
there are some problems with editable textfields in 0.3.4 beta6 (Falcon/CT60/CTPCI/Radeon, 1280*1024 screenres.):<br />
- The textfields are too small (half width they should be) and don't scroll horizontally when<br />
  typing (follow the textcursor). But it's strange: When i delete some long lines with keeping<br />
  BACKSPACE pressed, the textbox scrolls (follows cursor) like it should be!<br />
  If a line is longer than the textfield and i press ALT+CTL+CLEAR (screen update), the missing<br />
  part of this line is displayed right outside the textbox. I can't attach a snapshot because of<br />
  the limited attachment size here in forum (25 kB), but this happens in all Atari-forums i tested.<br />
- German NON-ASCII characters are not inserted correct, for example a german &quot;a with too dots<br />
  on top&quot; is inserted as a greek &quot;eta&quot;, i think..<br />
<br />

there is a serious problem in Highwire 0.3.4 ß4 (hw100125.zip) from<br />
[<a href="http://highwire.sourceforge.net/prototype-development.php"  rel="nofollow">highwire.sourceforge.net</a>] which was not<br />
present in 0.3.3 ß4:<br />
JPEG pictures are displayed with a shadow, means if there's a car in a<br />
picture then a transparent copy of the car is drawn some pixels to the left<br />
or right- just like &quot;shadowed&quot; text.<br />
For example see [<a href="http://aniplay.atari.org/"  rel="nofollow">aniplay.atari.org</a>] picture of LCD display.<br />
<br />
This happens on my Falcon/CT60 with MinT/XaAES/NVDI 256 colors/736*544p (with<br />
CNTSCREEN.PRG) and with MagiC, too (same res.).<br />

<br />
When accessing (login) squirrelmail, the webapp sends a bunch of http headers (set cookies, http redirect, etc.) to the client... highwire just displays the http response (no html, it's just a header, and it's cut somewhere before the real end...) and then does nothing. If i then put in the address that redirect.php would redirect me, the webapp works. :) <br />
<br />
Anyone knows about this?<br />
<br />
greets,<br />
