  I have had some nagging issues with highwire and wondering if anyone can help me to solve it.  I am currently running Macic 6.2 with Jinnee 2.5 on a Falcon CT60 at 95 mhz.  Whenever I startup Highwire 0.3.2 which was the last available download, it seems to be not loading images in and eventually gives me a No Route to Host error in Highwire.  I have been through My MagicNet setup and cannot see anything that would explain the issue, but I am sure I am missing something.  Can anyone zip up the latest Highwire (the entire package) and send it to me?  My address is <a href="mailto:&#102;&#97;&#108;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#48;&#54;&#48;&#64;&#114;&#111;&#97;&#100;&#114;&#117;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#102;&#97;&#108;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#48;&#54;&#48;&#64;&#114;&#111;&#97;&#100;&#114;&#117;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.  Once I get this running I would love to be a tester of the latest releases if at all possible.<br />
<br />

<br />
I want to develop for highwire - but the whole environment seems to be in a worse situation.<br />
I have an working 0.3.2 highwire development environment, but i don't wan't to develop for such an old version. <br />
<br />
1. The wikilink is dead: [<a href="http://highwire.atari-users.net/wiki"  rel="nofollow">highwire.atari-users.net</a>]<br />
2. The webbased cvs browser doesn't allow me to get the newest sources...:<br />
<br />
Error: Export failure (exit status 1), output: <br />
cvs export: failed to create lock directory for `/home/cvs/server-root/atariforge/highwire' (/home/cvs/server-root/atariforge/highwire/#cvs.lock): Permission denied<br />
cvs export: failed to obtain dir lock in repository `/home/cvs/server-root/atariforge/highwire'<br />
cvs [export aborted]: read lock failed - giving up<br />
<br />
anyone knows how to download via the real cmd line cvs client?<br />
<br />
3. There is no download for the newest sources on the main page.<br />
4. Because the wiki is down, this document: [<a href="http://highwire.atari-users.net/code_faq.txt"  rel="nofollow">highwire.atari-users.net</a>] should contain cvs access info, at least. <br />
5. I'm waiting for developers maillinglist approval - but nothing happens. <br />
6. This file is corrupted: [<a href="http://highwire.atari-users.net/hw_doc.htm"  rel="nofollow">highwire.atari-users.net</a>]<br />

cheers, <br />
