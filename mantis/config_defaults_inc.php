	# Custom Group Actions
	#
	# This extensibility model allows developing new group custom actions.  This
	# can be implemented with a totally custom form and action pages or with a 
	# pre-implemented form and action page and call-outs to some functions.  These
	# functions are to be implemented in a predefined file whose name is based on
	# the action name.  For example, for an action to add a note, the action would
	# be EXT_ADD_NOTE and the file implementing it would be bug_actiongroup_add_note_inc.php.
	# See implementation of this file for details.
	#
	# Sample:
	#
	# array(
	#	array(	'action' => 'my_custom_action',
	#			'label' => 'my_label',   // string to be passed to lang_get_defaulted()
	#			'form_page' => 'my_custom_action_page.php',
	#			'action_page' => 'my_custom_action.php'

	#	array(	'action' => 'my_custom_action2',
	#			'form_page' => 'my_custom_action2_page.php',
	#			'action_page' => 'my_custom_action2.php'
	#   )
	#	array(	'action' => 'EXT_ADD_NOTE',  // you need to implement bug_actiongroup_<action_without_'EXT_')_inc.php
