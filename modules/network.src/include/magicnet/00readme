This directory contains header files which are
not normally present for Pure-C. They are mostly
taken (with some modifications) from mintlib.

If you have similar files already in your standard include directory,
make sure they are identical. Or alternatively, change the project
files to add your standard include path *last*, then remove
that path from your shell options. This is important because otherwise
Pure-C picks the files in that standard path first, not our fixed
versions.
