            <h2>A Message from the HighWire Development Team</h2>
            <hr>
            <p><b><i>Welcome to the latest release of HighWire, 0.1.7!</i></b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 3 months and countless hours of working,
            here is the latest HighWire release. Much of the work has been done
            recoding the internal structures of HighWire to create better
            compatibility to the 'Document Object Model', mainly needed for CSS
            support.
            <p>Other changes:
            <blockquote>
              <p>- Support added for interlaced PNG image format.<br>
              <br>
              - Fixed a bug in the CSS parser which caused sometimes hangings on
              the <code>@import</code> command.<br>
              <br>
              - Implemented handling of cascading selectors, for CSS 1.0 as well
              as for 2.0 specification.<br>
              <br>
              - For lists and the tags <code>CENTER</code>, <code>BLOCKQUOTE</code>
              and <code>DIV</code> the CSS styles background-color,
              border-width/-color, margin, padding and text-indent are supported
              now.<br>
              <br>
              - Block level elements store <code>id='..'</code> attributes now
              and can be used for <code>&lt;a href=&quot;#id&quot;&gt;</code> .<br>
              <br>
              - Improved handling of floating text around tables<br>
              <br>
              - Reworked re-calculation of tables for handling of images inside
              tables without width specification.<br>
              <br>
              - Improved calculation of redraw areas for images of unknown size,
              reduces flickering caused by redraws.<br>
              <br>
              - Background color setting changed to avoid multiple drawings of
              identical backgrounds.<br>
              <br>
              - Workaround to catch malformed HTML (missing <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>
              as in CAB hotlists).<br>
              </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in helping with the HighWire
              project, don't hesitate to get in touch with any member of the
              development team and let them know. There are lots of areas where
              more people would make the job easier. If you can't program, then
              consider helping with the documentation or get involved with
              submitting bug reports. If you are a programmer and are interested
              in working on the code of HighWire, then definitely get in contact
              with the development team. Many sections of the code can seem
              quite confusing without knowing how some of the basics of the code
              works. There are also libraries that are needed to compile the
              code now that you can get from the development list. Translations
              into other languages would also be a nice addition to the project.
              While we have many different languages spoken by members of the
              development team, we only have language support for French and
              English.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is a modern browser needed for our
              platform. It is our belief that our best option is one that is
              native and open source. By native we mean something that was
              written with our machines in mind and Open Source so that we never
              have to worry about a programmer deciding to stop development.
              Even if the whole development team were to quit tomorrow the code
              would still be available and waiting for someone else to continue
              on the work. We believe that HighWire can fill this role. This
              technology is open source, so hopefully with your support it can
              be the core to many projects on our platform. Not the least of
              which will be in the future a fully modern web browser. To reach
              that goal we will need time and the help of community.</p>
