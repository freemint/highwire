In the table below we have an image that is to be right aligned. It somewhat is, but also wrapped out of the table cell in a quite amusing way in the second table example :)<br>
For some reason it seems like the glitch is not present (in first example) if the table cell is made a bit bigger than the image width. Note that the faulty wrapping of the image <i>only</I> happens when align is set to right!
