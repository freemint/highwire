The problem: It seems like when these conditions are met, the indention of list elements gets messed up:

1) The closing tag for LI is located on the row below (CR)
2) The list element is inside a header tag
3) The last char of the list entry is NOT a SPACE

</pre>


<ul>
<li><h3>1 This line entry will mess up the indention</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>2 This line entry will "reset" the indention (becase of the SPACE at the end) </h3>
</li>
<li><h3>3 This line entry will mess up the indention</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>4 This line entry will NOT mess up the indention (next row is back on track)</h3></li>

<li><h3>5 This line entry will mess up the indention</h3>
</li>
<li><font size="5">6 This line will not affect the indention mess</font>
</li>
<li><h3>We need a line with header tag to reset things it seems</h3></li>
<li>So this line should be back on track again..</li>
