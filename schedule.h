 * schedule.h -- Job control.

 * The scheduler maintains a list of jobs in a queue.  A job means a function to
 * be called along with an argument to be passed at the call.  After the call
 * the scheduler takes the return value of the funtion to decide wether the job
 * have to be placed in the queue again or can be removed.
 * It is the resposibility of an external timer function to make periodical
 * calls of schedule() to perform the jobs.
