(non-public of Oct. 01, 2003)

- Enabled loading and displaying of image files
  over remote connections.
  NOTE:  This will only work when the CACHEDIR is
  defined properly in HighWire's cfg file!!!

- New config keyword added to control how many
  memory shall be used for caching of image
  bitmaps in memory (not those on disk):
    CACHEMEM = <kilo bytes>
  When not defined 100k will be asumed.
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for details).

- Added lot of functionality for dithering and
  displaying of images, especially for GrayScale
  and TrueColor.

- Implemented support for 32k colours screen mode.

- Support for jpg and png implemented.

- Decreased a bit flickering of image rendering,
  by improved cache prefetches.

- Fixed the cache screwing up bug which occured
  when storing of files failed for some reason
  (eg. no cache dir defined in config).  This was
  leading to an infinite loop.

- Corrected cache size calculation for disk cached
  objects (#0126).

- Added automatic prepending of 'http://' when no
  protocol was given in the URL of the button bar
  (in fact, when neither a leading '/' nor any ':'
  was found there) (#0093).

- Fixed a bug occuring with both rowspan and
  colspan defined in one table cell (#0119).

- Fixed the 'too many open files' bug, resulting
  from forgotten socket close after connection
  failed.

- Fixed the infinite loop caused by too long lines
  in HTML textes.

- Corrected the handling of URLs for <frame> when
  a previous <base href=..> was found.

- Corrected clipping of infobar drawing for shaded
  or iconified windows (#0118).

- Implemented a pgrogress bar for the infobar to
  indicate how busy HighWire is with loading and
  rendering.

- Added several checks to avoid crashes due to
  memory exhausted.

- Bugs #0093, #0118, #0119, #0126 resolved.

Changes in V. 0.1.4 release  of August 10, 2003:

- Implemented disk caching of text/html files from
  remote (only per session yet).  To enable this
  feature the highwire.cfg file needs to include
  the line
    CACHEDIR = <path>
  where <path> must be a valid and writeable
  directory.

- Added a new config keyword to define the default
  background colour for pages that doesn't define
  any:
    DFLT_BACKGND = <colour>
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for details).

- The toolbar got a stop button now to allow page
  loading to be stopped.  The same function is
  implemented for the escape key now as well.
  Additional there is also a new button for open
  file now.

- Some adaptions for monochrome screen mode done.

- Improved history functionality to not messed up
  due to frames that are loaded from a different
  server than the frameset.  Furthermore slider
  positions of frames are stored also now.

- Implemented ID keyword as anchor for <P> and
  <Hx> tags, blanks in anchor names are filtered
  out now in general.

- Implemented <base href=...> tag (base URL for
  relative links in a document).

- Sound files from remote sites are now loaded
  also and can be played by external players.

- Fixed a problem with tables which were over-
  lapping other objects.

- Reworked config parser for faster program start
  on slow machines.

- Fixed a bug that was messing up the scheduler's
  job queue.

- Bugs #0092, #0114 resolved.

Changes in V. 0.1.3 release  of June 05, 2003:

- Implemented handling of shift + left/right
  cursor keys (page-wise horizontal scrolling).

- Double clicks on arrows of sliders are handled
  now in the same way as N.AES does (for left and
  right mouse button).

- New menu entry (under 'Options') to have frames
  always resizeable and scrollbars if necessary,
  even if the HTML defines anything else there.
  The default is off but can be set to on with the
  keyword FORCE_FRAMECTRL = 1 in the config file.

- New keyword FONT_MINSIZE to define a minimum
  font height in points, eg. for <font size=1>
  (see example.cfg\highwire.cfg for explanation).

- Added a fix for <meta http-equiv="refresh" ..>
  tags with large refresh URLs.

- Improved calculation of percent and fractional
  frame size values, makes it much more robust
  against faulty frameset tags.

- Corrected wrong setting of hanging indentions in
  and after lists.

- Corrected handling of table cells with both 
  colspan and rowspan set.

- Re-implemented <div> tag rendering to tables
  with one single cell, matches their meaning much
  more now than the previous implementation.

- Added resetting of font characteristics after
  tables and title tags, this was messing up the
  renderer while calculating text word widths
  (only rarely seen on some very simple pages).

- Set texts of buttons and input fields always to
  black.

- Removed several code redundancies.

- Bugs #0041, #0096, #0098, #0102, #0103, #0104,
  #0105, #0106, #0108, #0109, #0110 resolved.

- Changed the behaviour of the window's info bar
  to have it more logical and informative.

  given from <select name=foo><option value=bar>..
  tags.

  their cells, makes several pages looking a bit
  better.

  missing http: are supported now.

- Fixed a bug in parsing of plain text files which
  led to an endless loop on very long lines.

- Fixed a bug in the style=".." parsing function
  which could cause crashes before.

- Mended some more memory leaks.

- Overworked charset encoding to speedo encoding
  for better performance.

Changes in V.07 alpha  of July 24, 2002:

- Reworked configuration code, new keyword
  FONT_SIZE in the cfg file sets the base font
  size in point (default is 12pt).  If the
